# Keras CNN Pokémon Image Classifier

* Here's the [link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/unexpectedscepticism/11945-pokemon-from-first-gen?select=PokemonData) to training data.
* Unzip this and place it in the `CNN` root folder
* Rename `PokemonData` to `data` and ensure that the file structure is as such `CNN/data/train/...` where `...` are the actual Pokémon classes
* There should also be an empty `test` directory with this path `CNN/data/test`
* Install dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`
* Use `workspace.ipynb` to begin training
